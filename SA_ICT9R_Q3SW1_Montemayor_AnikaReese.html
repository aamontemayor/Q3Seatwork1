			<h3 class="text-light">Anne Shirley-Cuthbert</h3>
			<p class="text-light"><i>Played by Amybeth McNulty</i></p>
			<br>
			<p class="text-light">Anne Cordelia Shirley-Cuthbert is the titular protagonist of Anne. She is the orphaned daughter of Walter Shirley and Bertha Shirley, and the adoptive daughter of Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert. </p>
			<p class="text-light">The Cuthbert siblings wanted an orphan boy to help Matthew with the farm work, since both of them were getting older. Though, much to his surprise, Matthew found no boy when he went to the train station; there was only Anne. However, little by little, Anne wins over the hearts of both Marilla and Matthew, and therefore, they decide to adopt her.</p>
			<p class="text-light">Anne's heart is a heart of gold. Throughout the series Anne is constantly trying to gain the approval of her adoptive parents, her classmates and the townspeople of Avonlea. Despite her desire to please, Anne has a great deal of personal integrity and this unadulterated honesty can often gets her into big trouble.</p>

			<h3 class="text-light">Gilbert Blythe</h3>
			<p class="text-light"><i>Played by Lucas Jade Zumann</i></p>
			<br>
			<p class="text-light">Gilbert Blythe is one of the main characters from Anne with an E. He is a resident of Avonlea and Anne's love interest. Gilbert first encounters Anne in the woods by the school where she is being bullied by Billy Andrews.</p>
			<p class="text-light">Gilbert Blythe has short curly dark brown hair, roughish hazel eyes, and a mischievous smile. He is tall and lean. Gilbert is constantly described as handsome and has gained the attentions of many.</p>
			<p class="text-light">Gilbert Blythe's good-natured attitude, charm, and attractive looks easily makes him the most popular boy of any school he goes to, and the object of fancy for the majority of his female classmates. He's ambitious, as shown by his academic prowess, and caring. Before Anne Shirley's arrival, his position of 'best in class' was unchallenged. As a child, Gilbert possessed a certain maturity his peers lacked, most likely a result of his responsibilities at home, mainly taking care of his ill father.</p>

			<p class="text-light">Marilla Cuthbert can be negative and sarcastic at times, firmly held to her beliefs but she cares deeply about the people she loves and has a heart of gold. Although she initially sticks to her arguably old-fashioned ways, she does hint to having a sense of humour, allowing her to bond better with Anne in the future. While she seems cold and strict at first, she loves Anne as her own and becomes soft as Anne continues to be in her care.</p>
